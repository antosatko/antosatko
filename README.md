# About Me  
I’m a mostly self-taught computer science student with a deep curiosity about how things work under the hood. My main interests are **compilers**, **parsing**, and **system design**, but I’m always exploring new areas. 

Lately, I’ve been diving into **graphical programming**, focusing on its techniques and performance. I enjoy deep technical discussions and helping less experienced developers grow. In the long run, I want to explore every corner of programming, one deep dive at a time.

# Projects

## **Languages**
- **[Ruda](https://github.com/antosatko/Ruda)**  
  A general-purpose programming language designed for new programmers and game development from scratch (no engine). Ruda comes with a package manager and documentation generation tools to enhance the development experience.

- **[DandaScript](https://github.com/antosatko/DandaScript)**  
  My first dive into parsing, DandaScript is a runtime library that executes scripts in JSON format. It supports plugins for custom syntax, enabling scripting capabilities for JSON files.

## **Games**
- **[Automatomas](https://github.com/antosatko/automatomas)**  
  A cellular automaton game featuring falling sand and other dynamic elements, designed with performance in mind. It’s optimized to handle complex simulations efficiently.

- **[Dungoni](https://github.com/antosatko/Dungoni)**  
  A simple CLI dungeon explorer game (more of a fun experiment than a major project).

## **Parsing**
- **[Ruda-Parser](https://github.com/antosatko/Ruda-parser)**  
  A context-free, regex-less library for grammar declaration and parsing, built on concepts from my **Ruda** language. It provides an intuitive way to handle syntax and structure.

## **Graphical Interfaces**
- **[Rugui](https://github.com/antosatko/rugui)**  
  A UI library that manages layout and event handling similar to browser engines. It is designed to be paired with rendering and environment integration libraries (windowing, etc.). I'm currently reworking my design after hitting a limitation, focusing on an overhaul to enable more advanced features and improved performance. The progress is not public yet but will closely resemble [Rugui2](https://github.com/antosatko/rugui2) 

- **[rugui_wgpu](https://github.com/antosatko/rugui2)**  
  A **wgpu** renderer designed for the **Rugui** library, providing GPU-accelerated rendering for UI elements in modern graphics environments.
